# Detection-of-EEG-instability-in-neurological-disorders-using-the-DTM-function
This code is publicly available code for the paper "Quantifying instability in neurological disorders EEG based on phase space DTM function".
The dataset is too large to be uploaded, please download it by yourself based on the public dataset described in the paper.
The DTM_value file contains the extracted DTM1 and DTM2 values.
